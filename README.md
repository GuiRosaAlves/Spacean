Welcome to Spacean, an exciting 2D game that combines the vastness of space with the mysteries of the ocean! In this game, you'll take control of a powerful shark equipped with colored laser projectiles to defend against waves of enemies. Sharpen your reflexes and strategic thinking to survive and score big!

## Gameplay

- You control a shark that can shoot different colored laser projectiles: red, green, and blue.
- To defeat enemies, you must use the correct colored projectile. Red enemies are vulnerable to red projectiles, green enemies to green projectiles, and blue enemies to blue projectiles.
- Hitting enemies with the correct projectile grants bonus points, so aim carefully!
- Your shark's health is represented by its inner light. Every time your shark takes damage, its light level fades, If your shark's light level completely fades away, it's game over.

## Controls

- Move the shark: Use the keyboard arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Shoot projectiles:
  - Red projectile: Press Z key.
  - Green projectile: Press X key.
  - Blue projectile: Press C key.
